# Web Scraping Tool

## Overview

This web scraping tool is designed to automate the extraction of data from web pages. Utilizing Selenium WebDriver, it enables interaction with dynamic content and allows for the retrieval of information that may not be accessible through standard HTTP requests. This tool is particularly useful for scraping data from sites that require user interaction or are heavily reliant on JavaScript.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Capable of scraping data from web pages that utilize JavaScript to load content dynamically.
- **Element Manipulation**: Customize the visibility of specific elements on the page using JavaScript to facilitate clean data extraction.
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Designed to work with popular web browsers through WebDriver, ensuring compatibility with the latest web technologies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- Compatible web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure you have the appropriate WebDriver installed for your browser.

## Usage

To use the scraping tool, modify the `scrape.py` script to target the desired URL and specify the elements you wish to extract. For example:

```python
from selenium import webdriver

# Set up WebDriver
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
# Add any additional options here

driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
driver.get('https://example.com')

# Implement your scraping logic here
```

## Customization

Feel free to customize the tool to fit your scraping needs. You can add additional functions for data processing, storage, and further manipulation as necessary.
